## Group 60

We inspected the traffic using wireshark.

The device starts by sending some EAPOL messages to my network-card.
These messages are to establish a secure connection between them. 
Then the device sends a DHCP requeste and it gets an ip-address.
Then it sends a ARP request looking for the syssec.ewi.utwente.nl server. It then performs a TCP handshake between them.
The board then becomes active connects to the MQTT server and subscribes to led/wemos60/action. 
It regularly recieves MQTT commands from the server and sends back ACK messages over TCP.

We can intercept some messages using a man-in-the-middle attack, this allows us to sit inbetween the server and board, and decrypt their messages. 
We configured the mitmproxy attack as described in: https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/ (starting from step 2)
After mouning a MITM attack using the following command:
mitmproxy --mode transparent --showhost 

We restart the board and intercept a single message, we obtain an API key:
"apikey": "52Fqkjxc897I9i86HnM"

We can use this API key to then contact the server.
After performing the following curl request:
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"apikey":"52dFqkjxc897I9i86HnM"}'  http://syssec.ewi.utwente.nl/startup

We obtain the following credentials, with these we should be able to publish and subscribe to MQTT messages.
{"mgtt":{"host":"syssec.ewi.utwente.nl","password":"c9JFyl2h8L","port":1883,"username": "wemos60"}, "status":200}
