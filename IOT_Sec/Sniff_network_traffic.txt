We inspected the traffic using wireshark.

The board mostly subscribes to MQTT messages.
The board conducts a TCP handshake with the server, the issue with this handshake is that it is not done correctly, the packets are not signed by a CA.
After mouning a MITM attack using the following command:
mitmproxy --mode transparent --showhost --ssl-insecure
we obtain an API key:
"apikey": "52Fqkjxc897I9i86HnM"

After performing the following curl request:
curl -k -- header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST
--data '{"apikey": "52dFqkjxc89719186HnM"}' \
https://syssec.ewi.utwente.nl/startup

We obtain the following credentials, with these we should be able to publish and subscribe to MQTT messages.
