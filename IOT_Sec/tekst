The device starts by sending some EAPOL messages with a key to my network-card.
These messages are to establish a secure connection between them. 
Then the device sends some DHCP requests between it and the network-card. 
And it gets an ip-address.
Then it sends a ARP request looking for the syssec.ewi.utwente.nl server. It performs a TCP handshake between them.
