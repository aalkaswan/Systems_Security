We extract the firmware and import the files into Ghidra as shown in the lecture. We also add the brom? memory block, but this might not be neccesary. 

To start the search for commands we search for all strings in Ghidra. Looking through the found strings, we see an interesting one: "Message Arrived [".
This is the message that the board prints to the serial port. This string is only used in a single function, we will attempt to find the hidden commands in this function.
We believe that param_1 is the topic, since it it printed between the brackets behind "Message Arrived". param_2 is likely the command, param_3 is then likely the length of the command, since it is only an integer.
We exported the function to c, it will also be handed in with this report.

The first hidden command that we find is restart. In line 47, param_2 (which is likely the command) is compared with the string "restart ".
The rest of the command is compared with "90uG39tSNC3u2YTQ". This might be some kind of code that is unique per device.

While listening to the serial port using 'screen', we publish the message on MQTT:

mosquitto_pub -h 'syssec.ewi.utwente.nl' -u 'wemos60' -P 'C9JFyl2h8L' -t 'led/wemos60/action' -m 'restart 90uG39tSNC3u2YTQ'

This causes the board to restart and we can read a restart message from the serial port.

Message arrived [led/wemos60/action] Restart

We have found the restart command, we will further investigate this function of code in the 'Find all Hidden Commands' Assignment.
